## Who am I?

Hello! Thank you for visiting KENTO's personal website! I would like to share my backgroud and personal lives.
Again, I am Kento Morita, virtuous race, from Japan majoring in MS in Business Analytics (Data Science) as a master's student at UCI a.k.a The Paul Merage School of Business. I completed Bachelor of Data Science at Yokohama City Univeresity => this uni is ðŸ§¢ cuz it's not located at city part of Yokohama, meaning there's nothing around there.
